simulation
--------------------------------
### Our previous simulation may incorrect

  The previous simulation, including the simualtion strategy used in CPM, modeled the gene-expression of bulk RNA-Seq as the sum of the gene-expression of cells  multiplying the corresponding abundance. The generated cell-abudance vs cell-space is considered as the density distribution of cells along the cell-space.(see fig.1)
